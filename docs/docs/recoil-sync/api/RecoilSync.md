A React component that calls the [`useRecoilSync()`](/docs/recoil-sync/api/useRecoilSync) hook for the [Recoil Sync library](/docs/recoil-sync/introduction).  The props of the component are equivalent to the options for the hook.  You can use either the component or hook form, whichever is more convenient for you.
